## Installation
### Device
Make sure you have to build the device with the requirements below:
- 1 pcs - Arduino uno R3
- 1 pcs - Solenoid door lock (12 V)
- 1 pcs - Relay module 1 channel (5 V)
- 1 pcs - Keypad
- 1 pcs - LCD 16x2 I2C
- 2 pcs - Battery clip (9 V)
- 2 pcs - Battery Holder (9 V)
- Cable jumper

* For the better performance, you can change the battery to the higher voltage source
